Pick4Me is a restaurant (or whatever you want) picker app, developed in about an hour to solve a very real problem: indecisive roomates. It features a weighted list of choices, a random selection screen, is written with ruby/sinatra/haml, and is limited to only one set of choices as of now.

Enjoy!
